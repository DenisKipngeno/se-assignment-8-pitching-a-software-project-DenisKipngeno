Competitors like XYZ offer similar solutions, but our AI-driven approach provides a distinct advantage by significantly improving accuracy and efficiency."

# 5. Unique Selling Proposition (USP): Explain the concept of a Unique Selling Proposition (USP). How do you identify and articulate your software project's USP in your pitch?
#### A USP is a factor that differentiates your product from competitors, making it unique and more attractive to potential customers.
## Identifying and articulating your USP:
#### Identify: Determine what sets your software apart, such as unique features, technology, user experience, or pricing.
#### Articulate: Clearly communicate this differentiation in a way that resonates with your audience.
